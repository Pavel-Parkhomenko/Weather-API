# Weather app
Weather viewing apps with a choice of any city

## Some information about the implementation
- An application that displays the weather in populated areas with additional visualization. At the first stage, the user's location is determined automatically.  
- Additional visualization involves changing the background and the main
image of the weather (gray background in the rain and the image of rain, bright background in clear weather and the image of sunny weather, and so on).
- The application looks great both on large screens and on mobile phone and tablet screens. 
- Requests for weather services are cached to avoid blocking on free and public providers and
reduce traffic.
